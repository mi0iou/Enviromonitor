Enviromonitor
=========================

This simple program demonstrates some of the capabilities of the "Sense Hat" for the Raspberry Pi,
which is also known as the "Astro Pi"

The program measures the ambient temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure and 
displays each in turn on the Sense Hat's LED matrix as scrolling text.

To make things a little more interesting, each time the user interacts with the Sense Hat by 
pressing the joystick, the colour of the scrolling text changes.

Please feel free to fork and modifiy this program as you wish.
